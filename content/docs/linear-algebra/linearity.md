f \text{ linear} \iff f(\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha f(x) + \beta f(y)

## Why linearity?

<!-- What rank really represents? The real dimensionality of the  vector space -->

## Linear system of equations

### Gauss method

### Determinant
{{<hint info>}}
History time! Did you know that the concept of the _determinant_ was devised way earlier than the concept of a _matrix_?

This is because Arabs ...
So the name _determinant_ was given to it because it **determines** whether a system of linear equations is solvable. And the name _matrix_ was meant to refer as a ; the **mother** of the _determinant_. BOOM! ðŸ¤¯

\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)

## Inverse

A A^{-1} = I

{{<katex display>}}
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} A^\dagger
