Did you know that the concept of the determinant was devised way earlier than the concept of a matrix?
This is because Arabs &amp;hellip; So the name determinant was given to it because it determines whether a system of linear equations is solvable.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Product States (MPS)</title><link>http://mofeing.xyz/tensor-networks/docs/structured-tensor-networks/mps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mofeing.xyz/tensor-networks/docs/structured-tensor-networks/mps/</guid><description>Matrix Product States are a kind of</description></item><item><title>Factorization</title><link>http://mofeing.xyz/tensor-networks/docs/linear-algebra/factorization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mofeing.xyz/tensor-networks/docs/linear-algebra/factorization/</guid><description>What is the spectrum? # Eigendecomposition # Eigendecomposition is the diagonalization of the
You can view it as change of basis to the vector space whose basis is formed by the eigenvectors.
\[A = U \Lambda U^\dagger\] where \(U\) is &amp;hellip; and \(\Lambda\) is a diagonal matrix filled with the eigenvalues.
\[A v = \lambda v\] \[(A - \lambda I) v = 0\] Relationship with the determinant # The determinant is 0 if and only at least one of the eigenvalues Î» is 0.</description></item></channel></rss>
